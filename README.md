## Overview

### The challenge

The goal of this project was to create a working clone of the Wordle game.

Users should be able to:

    - Enter input using the in-app keyboard
    - Enter input using a physical keyboard
    - See what letters are valid and which are invalid on the in-app keyboard
    - See which words they've guessed
    - See how many guesses you have made / how many you have left
